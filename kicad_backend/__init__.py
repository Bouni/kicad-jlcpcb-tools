"""Reach the open KiCad board through one interface, whichever way KiCad offers.

Shared code reads the board through ``BoardBackend`` and sees only the
immutable records in ``records``; ``fake`` holds a board in memory for
tests. The ``swig`` package implements the interface over KiCad's SWIG
bindings. Other code still works on SWIG objects, among them fabrication,
DRC, the variant adapter and the board edits, until later changes move it
behind the interface.
